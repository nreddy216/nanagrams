# nanagrams
## A game that's like Bananagrams...but one-player....and nana-themed.

TODOs:
1. Get drag & drop functionality to work for the tiles
2. Access Merriam-Webster's API for a real dictionary :)
3. Peel & Dump buttons should function properly.
4. Get a timer and stop the game when it runs out.
5. Make it nana-themed?

* The game is now able to search vertically and horizontally for words and check whether the word is in the temporary dictionary array.
* Letters can automatically & randomly populate - currently, there are only 17 since the board has only 36 slots.

* Wrote 'user stories' to organize TODOs: https://trello.com/b/geCES9ro/nanagrams
* Created a temporary board & a few temporary tiles
* Click functionality included: When a player clicks a tile then clicks a cell, the tile appends to the cell.
