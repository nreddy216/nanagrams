# nanagrams
## A game that's like Bananagrams...but one-player....and nana-themed.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the WordNik API to create this game.

Currently this game is under construction, so the code is messy and redundant. If you would like to contribute in the future, contact me!

TODOs:
* Timer!
* The "WIN" function does not work
* Styling updates and CSS bug fixes
* Refactor ( a lot! )

* The tiles are able to drag & drop
* The program accesses the Wordnik API to check whether the words are legitimate.
* New additions: Peel & Dump buttons. They ~mostly~ work, but need to be tweaked.
* I made it nana-themed. It looks gloriously hideous. You're welcome.

* The game is now able to search vertically and horizontally for words and check whether the word is in the temporary dictionary array.
* Letters can automatically & randomly populate - currently, there are only 17 since the board has only 36 slots.

* Wrote 'user stories' to organize TODOs: https://trello.com/b/geCES9ro/nanagrams
* Created a temporary board & a few temporary tiles
* Click functionality included: When a player clicks a tile then clicks a cell, the tile appends to the cell.
