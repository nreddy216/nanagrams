# nanagrams

##Overview
A game that's like Bananagrams...but one-player....and nana-themed.

Instructions:
* Create a crossword using the tiles below.
* If you get stuck, drag your unwanted tile to DUMP.
* Once you have used up your tiles, click PEEL to get another tile.

##Planning

I decided to use Trello to organize my user stories and created a wireframe in Balsamiq.

##Technology

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript, jQuery, & jQuery UI for the drag/drop functionality
* WordNik API

##Future features & TODOs

TODOs:
* Timer!
* The "WIN" function does not work
* START Button
* WIN End Screen
* Styling updates and CSS bug fixes
* Refactor ( a lot! )

Other Features:
* Animated grandmas
* Make a nonsense poem using the words they made
* Highlight the tiles RED when the word is wrong & Highlight the tiles GREENish when the word is right

##Timeline:

02/04/2016

* The tiles are able to drag & drop
* The program accesses the Wordnik API to check whether the words are legitimate.
* New additions: Peel & Dump buttons. They ~mostly~ work, but need to be tweaked.
* I made it nana-themed. It looks gloriously hideous. You're welcome.


02/03/2016

* The game is now able to search vertically and horizontally for words and check whether the word is in the temporary dictionary array.
* Letters can automatically & randomly populate - currently, there are only 17 since the board has only 36 slots.

02/02/2016

* Wrote 'user stories' to organize TODOs: https://trello.com/b/geCES9ro/nanagrams
* Created a temporary board & a few temporary tiles
* Click functionality included: When a player clicks a tile then clicks a cell, the tile appends to the cell.
