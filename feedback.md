| | Score | Commentary |
|---|---|---|
| **Project WorkFlow** | 2 | Your `readme` is great, solid markup skills, and thanks for the shoutout. Nice job organizing and writing user-stories. It shows that you spent a lot of effort planning, as you delivered a well-defined and polished final product. Nice job committing frequently. Next time try to match the message more deliberately to the completed user stories. |
| **Technical Requirements** | 1.5 | You demonstrated the ability to synthesize your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a cohesive project. More specifically you demonstrated proficiency in JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and technical planning. |
| **Creativity** | 1.5 | Love the Nana theme! It's a fun game to play. I'm not sure how to win; at least I couldn't :( Over all it's a very well-scoped project that had a clear end goal in mind. Happy you got so much functionality working! |
| **Code Quality** | 1.5 | Great commenting and organization of your code. Love the semantically named, modular functions, keep it up! Would be happy to talk about opportunities for refactoring, but this is great for a first sprint. Overall, there's a lot of functionality to your game; it's clear you are getting dangerous at this and understand a lot the more challenging concepts of the language... Impressive! :) |
| **Problem Solving** | 2 | You worked very independently and thoughtfully was able to tackle a large problem and break it down into smaller pieces. You asked well-informed, researched questions and was able to internalize and act on feedback/suggestions. Nice job staying motivated, level headed, and organized throughout. You'd be a great member or leader on any team! |
